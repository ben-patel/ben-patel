- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ben-patel
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++, data structures/algos and HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate any interesting projects.
-  I'm a big fan of competitive programming, I'm still just a beginner but I've recently just solved over 100 questions on codeforces.
